# ðŸ’¥ What's new

v1.6.8

- Fixed the navbar, fully functional (only thing left is adding the websites)
- Completely revamped the website code, organised code (Thanks to Pranjal :D)
- Change font style, background
- Added transitions and animations to buttons

Technical changes:

- `components` now contains all JSX components used in the website. (Currently the file format is js, but it will be changed to JSX)
- `assets` contains images housing all images, favicons, etc.
- `styles` holds all the CSS-side of the code (CSS for components and normal elements)
  - `components` holds all CSS for components Only
  - `pages` holds CSS for webpages.

Huge Thanks to Pranjal for organizing the code, and fixing the bugs in the navbar! <3
